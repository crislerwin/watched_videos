# 🌍 What It's About

The video discusses a simple practice that takes 17 minutes and can significantly enhance attention and focus. It suggests that individuals, regardless of age or ADHD status, can benefit from this practice, which involves consciously dilating one's gaze into panoramic vision and focusing on internal sensations, termed interoception. The concept of attentional blinks, where over-focusing on certain elements leads to missing others, is highlighted, especially in individuals with ADHD. The practice, akin to meditation, has shown to reduce attentional blinks and improve focus even after a single session. The text also mentions the potential for this practice to offset age-related cognitive decline. Overall, the author emphasizes the simplicity and potential long-lasting benefits of a 17-minute interoception practice for rewiring attentional circuitry.
