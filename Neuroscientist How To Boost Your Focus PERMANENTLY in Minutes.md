# SUMMARY

The speaker discusses a simple 17-minute practice of focusing on one's breathing and internal state, which can significantly improve attention and focus, even in those with ADHD or age-related cognitive decline, after just a single session.

# IDEAS:

- 17-minute practice can rewire brain to improve focus
- Attentional blinks cause us to miss information we're not focused on
- People with ADHD may experience more attentional blinks
- Open monitoring/panoramic vision can help detect more information
- This practice works quickly and has lasting effects

# INSIGHTS:

- Improving focus is not just about trying harder, but training attentional circuits
- Distraction and inattention may stem from over-focusing on certain elements
- Simple practices can have profound impacts on cognitive abilities
- Harnessing the brain's flexibility can offset age-related cognitive decline

# QUOTES:

- "if ever there was a tool that stood to rewire our attentional circuitry in a powerful way this seems to be it"
- "these circuits that underlie focus on our ability to attend and our ability to eliminate distraction they aren't just failing to focus"
- "the ability to engage in panoramic Vision to dilate our gaze the so-called open monitoring that allows the brain to function in a way that it can detect more information faster"

# HABITS:

- Spend 17 minutes daily focusing on breathing and internal state
- Practice consciously dilating and contracting visual field
- Engage in open monitoring to broaden attention

# FACTS:

- Attentional blinks increase with age and in those with ADHD
- Panoramic vision has higher frame rate for processing information
- Single 17-minute session can have lasting effects on attention

# REFERENCES:

- Vipassana meditation
- Open gaze visual analysis

# RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Try 17-minute practice of focusing on breathing and internal state
- Experiment with consciously dilating and contracting visual field
- Explore open monitoring techniques to broaden attention
