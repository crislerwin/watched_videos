## SUMMARY

Neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf discusses the unnatural yet transformative power of reading on the human brain, highlighting the challenges and changes brought by digital media. She emphasizes the importance of deep reading for cognitive and emotional development, contrasting it with the fragmented and superficial reading common in the digital age.

## IDEAS:

- Reading is not a natural skill for humans but transforms the brain by creating new connections.
- The proliferation of digital media has changed how we read, often leading to more superficial engagement with text.
- Deep reading involves making analogies and inferences, crucial for critical thinking and empathy.
- The invention of literacy is relatively recent in human history but has significantly impacted knowledge sharing and storage.
- Reading fiction can enhance social skills and empathy, while poetry stimulates memory-related brain regions.
- Bibliotherapy, the practice of prescribing fiction for therapeutic benefits, has historical roots and recognized benefits.
- Digital reading can lead to poorer comprehension for complex or emotionally challenging texts compared to paper.
- The digital age has introduced fragmented and intermittent reading habits, potentially impacting cognitive and emotional aspects of reading.
- Transmedia storytelling and digital platforms offer new ways for storytelling and reader engagement.
- The concept of a "biletrate" brain suggests the possibility of adapting to both deep and digital reading modes without losing the benefits of traditional reading.
