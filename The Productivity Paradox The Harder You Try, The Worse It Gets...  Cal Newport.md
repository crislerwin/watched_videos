## SUMMARY

The speaker discusses the paradox of why some of the most remarkable people, who seem to embody the deep life many aspire to, are often not that busy. They explore this through three main ideas: the difference between hard work and hard-to-do work, how rare skills fuel remarkability, and the conclusion that remarkable lives don't require busyness. The discussion includes references to studies, personal habits of elite performers, and the traps that can lead to busyness despite one's best intentions.

## IDEAS:

- Remarkable people often appear less busy than others.
- Hard work is different from hard-to-do work; the former involves deliberate practice.
- Elite performers consolidate their work into focused periods.
- More sleep and relaxation correlate with higher performance among elite players.
- Rare and valuable skills provide leverage over one's professional life.
- Career capital is built through acquiring rare and valuable skills.
- Remarkability doesn't require busyness; it's about skill development.
- Avoiding traps that lead to increased busyness is crucial for maintaining remarkability.
- Opportunities can distract from deliberate practice and lead to unnecessary busyness.
- As skills improve, the scope of projects can increase, potentially leading to more busyness.
- Setting boundaries around new opportunities can help maintain focus on what's important.
- Variation in intensity of work can help manage larger projects without constant busyness.
- The paradox of the relaxed Rhodes Scholar illustrates that high achievement doesn't equate to busyness.
- Intentional living can include playing video games if chosen carefully and limited.
- The changing nature of work requires continuous reassessment of productivity strategies.
- Multiscale planning (daily, weekly, quarterly) helps manage tasks and priorities effectively.
- Communication rules, like office hours, can reduce the overload from asynchronous interactions.

## QUOTES:

- "If you're busy, you're doing something wrong."
- "Hard work is deliberate practice; it's not fun while you're doing it, but you don't have to do too much of it in any one given day."
- "Busyness and exhaustion should be your enemy if your goal is to build a remarkable life."
- "Rare skills fuel remarkability."
- "Career capital is what you invest into your working life to make it better."
- "Remarkable lives don't require busyness."
- "Busyness is orthogonal to developing rare and valuable skills."
- "Avoiding traps that lead to increased busyness is crucial for maintaining remarkability."
- "Intentional living can include playing video games if chosen carefully and limited."
- "The challenge in cultivating a sustainable approach to Modern knowledge work is to locate the space between productivity fetishism and the knee-jerk rejection of productivity thinking as toxic or unnecessary."

## HABITS:

- Elite performers consolidate their work into two well-defined periods.
- They sleep an hour more per night than average players.
- Elite players practice deliberate practice almost exclusively.
- They avoid spreading their work throughout the day unnecessarily.
- Setting boundaries around new opportunities to prevent them from taking over one's life.
- Using variation in intensity of work to manage larger projects without constant busyness.
- Regularly reassessing productivity strategies to adapt to the changing nature of work.
- Implementing multiscale planning (daily, weekly, quarterly) for task management.
- Establishing communication rules like office hours to manage interactions efficiently.
- Limiting video game play to high-quality, single-player games for a set time.

## FACTS:

- Elite musicians spend almost three times more hours on deliberate practice than average players.
- The elite players were significantly more relaxed than the average players.
- Rare and valuable skills provide leverage over one's professional life, offering more control and options.
- Opportunities can distract from deliberate practice and lead to unnecessary busyness as skills improve.
- The changing nature of work requires continuous reassessment of productivity strategies.

## RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Focus on deliberate practice rather than being busy for the sake of busyness.
- Build rare and valuable skills to increase your career capital and options for a remarkable life.
- Be wary of opportunities that may lead to increased busyness without contributing to your core goals.
