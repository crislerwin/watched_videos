 despite what you hear about artificial intelligence machines still can't think like a human but in the last few years they have become capable of learning and suddenly our devices have opened their 
 eyes and ears and cars have taken the wheel today artificial intelligence is not as good as you hope and not as bad as you fear but humanity is accelerating into a future that few can predict 
 that's why so many people are desperate to meet Kaiu Lee the Oracle of AI Kuli is in there somewhere in a selfie scrum at a Beijing internet conference his 50 million social media 
 followers want to be seen in the same frame because of his talent for engineering and genius for wealth I wonder do you think people around the world have any idea what's coming in 
 artificial intelligence I think most people have no idea and many people have the wrong idea but you do believe it's going to change the world I believe it's going to change the world more than 
 anything in the history of mankind more than election Lee believes the best place to be an AI capitalist is communist China his Beijing Venture Capital firm 
 manufactures billionaires these are the entrepreneurs that we funded he's funded 140 AI startups we have about10 billion companies here 101 billion companies that you funded yes including a few 10 
 billion companies in 2017 China attracted half of all AI capital in the world one of Lee's Investments is face Plus+ not affiliated with Facebook its visual 
 recognition system smothered me to guess my age it settled on 61 which was wrong I wouldn't be 61 for days on the street face Plus+ nailed everything that moved it's a kind of 
 artificial intelligence that has been made possible by three Innovations super fast computer chips all the world's data now available online and a revolution in programming called Deep 
 learning computers used to be given rigid instructions now they're programmed to learn on their own in the early days of AI people try to program the AI with how people think so I would 
 write a program to say U measure the size of the eyes and their distance measure the size of the nose measure the shape of the face and then if these things match then this is Larry and 
 that's John but today you just take all the pictures of Larry and John and you tell the system go at it and you figure out what separates Larry from John let's say you want the computer to 
 be able to pick men out of a crowd and describe their clothing will you simply show the computer 10 million pictures of men in various kinds of dress that that's what they mean by Deep learning 
 it's not intelligence so much it's just the brute force of data having 10 million examples to choose from so face Plus+ tagged me as male short hair black long sleeves black long pants it's wrong 
 about my gray suit and this is exactly how it learns when Engineers discover that error they'll show the computer a million Gra suits and it won't make that mistake again over a thousand classrooms 
 another recognition system we saw or saw us is learning not just who you are but how you feel now what are all the dots on the screen the dots over our eyes and our mouths sure the computer keeps track 
 all the feature points on the face son fany Yang developed this for talal Education Group which tutors 5 million chines students let's look at what we're seeing here now according to the 
 computer I'm confused which is generally the case but when I laughed I was happy exactly that's amazing the machine notices concentration or distraction to pick out for the teacher those students 
 who are struggling or gifted it can tell when the child is excited about math yes or the other child is excited about poetry yes could these AI systems pick out Geniuses from 
 the countryside that's possible in the future it can also create a student profile and know where the student got stuck so the teacher can personalize the areas in which the student needs help if 
 you do raise up your hand we found Kaiu Lee's personal passion in this spare Beijing Studio he's projecting top teachers into China's poorest schools this English teacher is connected to a 
 class 1,000 miles away in a village called defang many students in defang are called Left behinds because their parents left them with family when they 
 moved to the cities for work most left behinds don't get past 9th grade topic we're going to learn today Lee is counting on AI to deliver for them the same opportunity he had 
 when he immigrated to the US from Taiwan as a boy when I arrived in Tennessee my principal took every lunch to teach me English and that is the kind of 
 attention that I've not been used to Growing Up in Asia and I felt that the American classrooms are smaller encouraged individual thinking critical thinking and I felt um it was the best 
 thing that ever happened to me what about this and the best thing that ever happened to most of the engineers we met at Le's firm I went to K master degree in information science they too are 
 alumni of America with a dream for China you have written that silicon Valley's Edge is not all it's cracked up to be what do you mean by that well Silicon Valley has been the single epicenter of 
 the world technology Innovation when it comes to computers internet mobile and AI but in the recent five years we are seeing the Chinese AI is getting to be almost as good as Silicon Valley Ai and 
 I think Silicon Valley is not quite aware of it yet China's Advantage is in the amount of data it collects the more data the better the AI just like the more you know the smarter you 
 are China has four times more people than the United States and they are doing nearly everything online I just don't see any Chinese without a phone in their head college student Monica Sun 
 showed us how more than a billion Chinese are using their phones to buy everything find anything and connect with everyone in America when personal information 
 leaks we have Congressional hearings not in China you ever worry about the information that's being collected about you where you go what you buy who you're with I I never think about it do you 
 think most Chinese worry about their privacy um not that much not that much with a plant public the leader of the Communist party has made a national priority of achieving AI dominance in 10 
 years this is where Kaiu Lee becomes uncharacteristically shy even though he's a former Apple Microsoft and Google executive he knows who boss in China president XI has called technology the 
 sharp weapon of the modern State what does he mean by that I I am not an expert in interpreting his thoughts don't know there are those particularly people in the west who 
 worry about this AI technology as being something that governments will use to control their people and to crush dcent that as Aventure capitalists we don't we don't invest in this area and 
 we're not studying deeply this particular problem but governments do it's certainly possible for governments to use the Technologies just like companies Lee is much more talkative 
 about another threat posed by AI he explores the coming destruction of jobs in a new book AI superpowers China Silicon Valley and the New World Order AI will increasingly replace repetitive 
 jobs not just for blue color work but a lot of white color work what sort of jobs would be lost to AI basically chauffeur truck drivers uh anyone who does driving for a living uh their jobs 
 will be disrupted more in the 50 15 to 20 year uh time frame and many jobs that seem a little bit complex uh Chef waiter uh a lot of things will become automated we'll have automated stores uh automated 
 restaurants and uh Al together in 15 years that's going to uh displace uh about 40% of jobs in the world 40% of jobs in the world will be 
 displaced by technology ology uh I would say displaceable what does that do to the fabric of society well in some sense there's the human wisdom that always overcomes these 
 technology revolutions the invention of the steam engine uh the sewing machine the uh electricity uh have all displaced jobs uh and we've gotten over it the 
 challenge of AI is this 40% whether it's 15 or 25 years is coming faster than the previous revolutions there's a lot of hype about artificial intelligence and it's 
 important to understand this is not general intelligence like that of a human this system can read faces and grade papers but it has no idea why these children are in this 
 room or what the goal of education is a typical AI system can do one thing well but can't adapt what it knows to any other task so for now it may be that calling 
 this intelligence isn't very smart when will we know that a machine can actually think like a human back when I was a grad students people said if machine can 
 drive a car uh by itself that's intelligence now we say that's not enough so the bar keeps moving higher I think that's uh I guess more motivation for us to work harder but if you're 
 talking about AGI artificial general intelligence I would say not within the next 30 Years and possibly never possibly Never What's So insurmountable CU I believe in the 
 sanctity of our soul I believe there's a lot of things about us that we don't understand I believe there's a lot of um uh love and compassion that is not explainable in terms of neural networks 
 and computational algorithms and I currently see no way of solving them obviously unsolved problems have been solved in the past but it would be irresponsible for me to predict that 
 these will be solved by certain time frame we may just be more than our bits we may we may look on our time as the moment civilization was transformed as 
 it was by fire Agriculture and electricity in 2023 we learned that a machine taught itself how to speak to humans like a peer which is to say with creativity truth error and lies the 
 technology known as a chatbot is only one of the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence machines that can teach themselves superhuman skills we explored what's coming next at Google 
 a leader in this new world CEO Sundar Pai told us AI will be as good or as evil as human nature allows the revolution he says is coming faster than you 
 know do you think Society is prepared for what's coming you know there are two ways I think about it on one hand I feel no uh because you know the pace at which we can think and adapt as 
 societal institutions compared to the PACE at which the technology is evolving there seems to be a mismatch on the other hand compared to any other technology I've seen more 
 people worried about it earlier in its life cycle so I feel optimistic the number of people you know who have started worrying about the implications and hence the conversations are starting 
 in a serious way as well I guess our conversations with 50-year-old Sundar Pai started at Google's new campus in Mountain View California it runs on 40% solar power and collects more water than 
 it uses Hightech that pachai couldn't have imagined growing up in India with no telephone at home we were on a waiting list to get a rotary phone and for about 5 years and it finally came 
 home I can still recall it vividly it changed our lives to me it was the first moment I understood the power of what getting access to technology meant so probably led me to be doing what I'm 
 doing today what he's doing since 2019 is leading both Google and its parent company alphabet valued at $1.3 trillion worldwide Google runs 90% of 
 internet searches and 70% of smartphones we're really excited about but its dominance was attacked this past February when Microsoft linked its search engine to a chatbot in a race for 
 AI dominance Google just released its chatbot named Bard it's really here to help you brainstorm ideas to generate content like a speech or a blog post or an email we were introduced to Bard by 
 Google vice president sha and senior Vice President James manika here's Bard the first thing we learned was that Bard does not look for answers on the internet like Google search does 
 so I wanted to get inspiration from some of the best speeches in the world Bard's replies come from a self-contained program that was mostly self-taught our experience was unsettling confounding 
 absolutely confounding Bard appeared to possess the sum of human knowledge with microchips more than 100,000 times faster than the human brain summarize the we asked Bard to 
 summarize the New Testament it did in 5 seconds and 17 words in Latin we asked for it in Latin that took another 4 seconds then we played with a famous six-word short story often attributed to 
 Hemingway for sale baby shoes news never worn wow the only prompt we gave was finish this story in 5 seconds holy cow the shoes were a gift 
 from my wife but we never had a baby they were from The six-word Prompt Bard created a deeply human tale with characters it invented including a man whose wife could not conceive and a 
 stranger grieving after a miscarriage and longing for closure uh I am rarely speechless I don't know what to make of this give me we asked for the story in 
 verse in 5 seconds there was a poem written by a machine with breathtaking insight into the mystery of Faith Bard wrote she knew her baby soul would always be 
 alive the humanity at superhuman speed was a shock how is this possible James manika told us that over several months Bard read most everything on the internet and created a model of what 
 language looks like rather than search its answers come from this language model so for example if I said to you Scott peanut butter and jelly right so it tries and learns to predict okay so 
 peanut butter usually is followed by jelly it tries to predict the most probable next words based on everything it's learned uh so it's not going out to find stuff it's just predicting the next 
 word but it doesn't feel like that we asked Bard why it helps people and it replied quote because it makes me happy B to my eye appears to be thinking appears to be making 
 judgments that's not what's happening these machines are not sensient they are not aware of themselves they're not sentient they're not aware of themselves uh they can exhibit behaviors that look 
 like that because keep in mind they've learned from us we are sentient beings we have beings that have feelings emotions ideas thoughts perspectives we've reflected all that in books in 
 novels in fiction so when they learn from that they build patterns from that so it's no surprise to me that the exhibited behavior sometimes looks like maybe there's somebody behind it there's 
 nobody there these are not sensient beings they're not Zimbabwe born Oxford educated James manika holds a new position at Google his job is to think about how Ai and Humanity will best 
 coexist AI has a potential to change many ways in which we've thought about Society about what we're able to do the the problems we can solve but AI itself will pose its own problems could Heming 
 way write a better short story maybe but Bard can write a million before Hemingway could finish one imagine that level of automation across the economy a lot of people can be replaced by this 
 technology yes there are some job occupations that will start to decline over time there are also new job categories that will grow over time but the biggest change will be the jobs that 
 will be changed something like more than 2third will have their definitions change not go away but change because they're now being assisted by Ai and by automation so this is a profound change 
 which has implications for skills how do we assist people build new skills learn to work alongside machines and how do these complement what people do today this is going to impact every product 
 across every company and and so that's why I think it's a a very very profound technology and so we are just in early days every product in every company that's right AI will impact everything 
 so for example you could be a radiologist you know if I if you think about 5 to 10 years from now you're going to have a AI collabor with you it may triage you come in the morning you 
 let's say you have 100 things to go through it may say these are the most serious cases you need to look at first or when you're looking at something it may pop up and say you may have missed 
 something important why wouldn't we you know why would we take advantage of a superpowered assistant to help you across everything you do you may be a student trying to learn math or history 
 and you know you will have something helping you we asked Pai what jobs would be disrupted he said knowledge workers people like writers accountants Architects and ironically software 
 Engineers AI writes computer code too today Sundar pachai walks a narrow line a few employees have quit some believing that Google's AI rollout is too slow others too fast there are some serious 
 flaws there's a return of inflation James manika asked Bard about inflation it wrote an instant essay in economics and recommended five books but days later we checked none of the books is 
 real Bard fabricated the titles this very human trait error with confidence is called in the industry hallucination are you getting a lot of hallucinations uh yes uh you know which 
 is expected no one in the in the field has yet solved the hallucination problems all models uh do have uh this as an issue is it a solvable problem it's a matter of intense debate I think 
 we'll make progress to help cure hallucinations Bard features a Google it button that leads to oldfashioned search Google has also built safety filters in debard to screen for things like hate 
 speech and bias how great a risk is the spread of disinformation AI will challenge that in a deeper way the scale of this problem is going to be much bigger bigger problems he says with fake 
 news and fake images it will be possible with AI to create uh you know a video easily where it could be Scott saying something or me saying something and we never said that and it could look 
 accurate but you know at a societal scale you know can cause a lot of harm is Bard safe for society the way we have launched it today uh as an experiment in a limited 
 way uh I think so but we all have to be responsible in each step along the way Pai told us he's being responsible by holding back for more testing Advanced versions of Bard that he says can reason 
 and connect to internet search you are letting this out slowly so that Society can get used to it that's one part of it uh one part is also so that we get the user feedback 
 and we can develop more robust safety layers before we build before we deploy more capable models interacting of the AI issues we talked about the most mysterious is called emergent property 
 some AI systems are teaching themselves skills that they weren't expected to have how this happens is not well understood for example one Google AI program adapted on its own after it was 
 prompted in the language of Bangladesh which it was not trained to know we discovered that with very few amounts of prompting in Bengali he can now Translate all of Bengali so now all of a 
 sudden we now have a research effort where we're now trying to get to a thousand languages there is an aspect of this which we call all of us in the field call it as a black box you know 
 you don't fully understand and you can't quite tell why it said this or why it got wrong we have some ideas and our ability to understand this gets better over time but that's where the state of 
 the art is you don't fully understand how it works and yet you turned it loose on society let me put it this way I don't think we fully understand how a human mind works either was it from that 
 black box we wondered that Bard Drew its short story that seems so disarmingly human it talked about the pain that humans feel it talked about Redemption how did it do all of those 
 things if it's just trying to figure out what the next right word is me I've had these experiences uh talking with b as well there are two views of this you know there are a set of people who view 
 this is look these are just algorithms they're just repeating what it's seen online then there is the view where these algorithms are showing emerging properties to be creative to reason to 
 plan and so on right and and personally I think we need to be uh we need to approach this with humility part of the reason I think it's good that some of these Technologies are getting out is so 
 that Society you know people like you and others can process what's happening and we begin this conversation and debate and I think it's important to do that when we come back we'll take you 
 inside Google's artificial intelligence Labs where robots are learning the revolution in artificial intelligence is the center of a debate 
 ranging from those who hope it will save Humanity to those who predict Doom Google lies somewhere in the optimistic middle introducing AI in steps so civilization can get used to it we saw 
 what's coming next in machine learning at Google's AI lab in London a company called Deep Mind where the future looks something like this look at that oh my goodness they've 
 got a pretty good kick on them can still get quite a good good game a soccer match at Deep Mind looks like fun in games but here's the thing humans did not program these robots to play they 
 learned the game by themselves it's coming up with these interesting different strategies different ways to walk different ways to block and they're doing it they're scoring over and over 
 again this robot here Rya hadel vice president of research and Robotics showed us how Engineers used motion capture technology to teach the AI program how to move like a human but on 
 the soccer pitch the robots were told only that the object was to score the self-learning program spent about 2 weeks testing different moves it disgarded those that didn't work built 
 on those that did and created allars there's another goal and with practice they get better Hansel told us that independent from the robots the AI program plays thousands of games from 
 which it learns and invents its own tactics here you think that red player is going to grab it but instead it just stops IT hands it back passes it back and then goes for the goal and the AI 
 figured out how to do that on its own that's right that's right and it takes a while at first all the players just run after the ball together like a gaggle of uh you know six-year-olds the first time 
 they're they're they're playing ball over time what we start to see is now ah what's the strategy you go after the ball I'm coming around this way or we should pass or I should block while you 
 get to the goal so we see all of that coordination um emerging in the play this is a lot of fun but what are the practical implications of what we're seeing here this is the type of research 
 that can eventually lead to robots that can come out of the factories and work in other types of human environments you know think about mining think about dangerous construction work um or 
 exploration or Disaster Recovery these are Rya hadel is among 1,000 humans at Deep Mind the company was co-founded just 12 years ago by CEO Deus hassabis so if I think back to 2010 when we 
 started nobody was doing AI there was nothing going on in Industry people used to ey roll when we talked to them investors about doing AI so we couldn't we could barely get two cents together 
 to start off with which is crazy if you think about now the billions being invested into AI startups Cambridge Harvard MIT havabus has degrees in computer science and 
 Neuroscience his PhD is in human imagination and imagine this when he was 12 in his age group he was the number two chess champion in the world it was through games that he came 
 to AI I've been working on AI for for decades now and I've always believed that it's going to be the most important invention that Humanity will ever make 
 will the pace of change outstrip our ability to adapt I don't think so I think that we um you know we're sort of an infinitely adaptable species um you know you look 
 at today us using all of our smartphones and other devices and we effortlessly sort of adapt to these new technologies and this is going to be another one of those changes like that among the 
 biggest changes at Deep Mind was the discovery that self-learning machines can be creative so this isaba showed us a game playing program that learns it's called Alpha zero and it dreamed up a 
 winning chess strategy no human had ever seen but this is just a machine how does it achieve creativity it plays against itself tens tens of millions of times so it can explore um parts of Chess that 
 maybe human chess players and and and programmers who program chess computers haven't thought about before it never gets tired it never gets hungry it just plays chess all the time yes it's it's 
 kind of amazing thing to see because actually you set off Alpha zero in the morning uh and it starts off playing randomly by lunchtime you know it's able to beat me and beat most chess players 
 and then by the evening it's stronger than the world champion Deus saaba so deep mind to Google in 2014 one reason was to get his hands on this Google has the enormous computing 
 power that AI needs this Computing Center is in Prior Oklahoma but Google has 2 of these putting it near the top in computing power in the world this is one of two advances that make AI 
 ascendant now first the sum of all human knowledge is online and second Brute Force Computing that very Loosely approximates the neural networks and talents of the brain things like memory 
 imagination planning reinforcement learning these are all things that are known about how the brain does it and we wanted to replicate some of that uh in our AI systems you predict one of those 
 indiv those are some of the elements that led to deep mind's greatest achievement so far solving an impossible problem in biology proteins are building blocks of 
 life but only a tiny fraction were understood because 3D mapping of just one could take years deep mine created an AI program for the protein problem and set it Loose well it took us about 
 four or five years to to figure out how to build the system it was probably our most complex project we've ever undertaken but once we did that it can solve uh a protein structure in a matter 
 of seconds and actually over the last year we did all the 200 million proteins that are known to science how long would it have taken using traditional methods well the rule of thumb I was always told 
 by my biologist friends is that it it takes a whole PhD 5 years to do one protein structure experimentally so if you think 200 million time 5 that's a billion years of PhD time it would have 
 taken Deep Mind Made its protein database public a gift to humanity hbas called it how has it been used it's been used in an enormously broad number of ways actually from U malaria vaccines to 
 developing new enzymes that can eat plastic waste um to new uh antibiotics most AI systems today do one or maybe two things well the soccer robots for example can't write up a grocery list or 
 book your travel or drive your car the ultimate goal is what's called artificial general intelligence a learning machine that can score on a wide range of talents would such a 
 machine be conscious of itself so that's another great question we you know philosophers haven't really settled on a definition of Consciousness yet but if we mean by sort of self-awareness and uh 
 these kinds of things um you know I think there is a possibility AIS one day could be I definitely don't think they are today um but I think again this is one of the fascinating scientific things 
 we're going to find out on this journey towards AI even unconscious current AI is super superhuman in narrow ways back in California we saw Google Engineers 
 teaching skills that robots will practice continuously on their own push the blue cube to the blue triangle they comprehend instructions push the yellow hexagon to the yellow heart and learn to 
 recognize objects what would you like how about an apple how about an apple on my way I will bring an apple to you we're trying Vincent van senior director of Robotics showed us how robot 106 was 
 trained on millions of images I am going to pick up the apple and can recognize all the items on a crowded countertop if we can give the robot A diversity of experiences a lot more different objects 
 in different settings the robot gets better at every one of them now that humans have pulled the forbidden fruit of artificial knowledge thank you we start the Genesis of a new Humanity 
 AI can utilize all the information in the world what no human could ever hold in their head and I wonder if humanity is diminished by this enormous capability 
 that we're developing I think the possibilties of AI do not diminish uh Humanity in any way and in fact in some ways I think actually raise us to even deeper more 
 profound questions Google's James manika sees this moment as an inflection point I think we're constantly adding these superpowers or capabilities to what humans can do in a way that expands 
 possibilities as opposed to narrow them I think so I don't think of it as diminishing humans but it does raise some really profound questions for us who are we what do we value you uh what 
 are we good at how do we relate with each other those become very very important questions that are constantly going to be in one case sense exciting but perhaps unsettling too it is an 
 unsettling moment critics argue the rush to AI comes too fast while competitive pressure among giants like Google and startups you've never heard of is propelling Humanity into the Future 
 Ready or Not but I think if I take a 10year Outlook it is so clear to me we will have some form of very capable intelligence that can do amazing things 
 and we need to adapt as a society for it Google CEO Sundar Pai told us Society must quickly adapt with regulations for AI in the economy laws to punish abuse and treaties among Nations to make AI 
 safe for the world you know these are deep questions and you know we call this alignment you know one way we think about how do you develop AI systems that are aligned to human values and 
 including uh morality this is why I think the development of this needs to include not just Engineers but social scientists ethicists philosophers and so on and I 
 think we have to be be very thoughtful and I think these are all things Society needs to figure out as we move along it's not for a company to decide we'll end with a note that has 
 never appeared on 60 Minutes but one in the AI Revolution you may be hearing often the proceeding was created with 100% human content 
 the large tech companies Google meta slfb Microsoft are in a race to introduce new artificial intelligence systems and what are called chatbots that you can have conversations with and 
 are more sophisticated than Siri or Alexa Microsoft's AI search engine and chatbot Bing can be used on a computer comp or cell phone to help with planning a trip or composing a letter it was 
 introduced on February 7th to a limited number of people as a test and initially got rave reviews but then several news organizations began reporting on a disturbing so-called Alter Ego within 
 Bing chat called Sydney we went to Seattle last week to speak with Brad Smith president of Microsoft about about Bing and Sydney who to some had appeared to have gone 
 Rogue Kevin Roose the technology reporter at the New York Times found this Alter Ego uh who was threatening expressed a desire it's not just Kevin ruse it's others expressed a desire to 
 steal nuclear codes threaten to ruin someone you saw that whoa what was your you must have said oh my God my reaction is we better fix this right away and that is what the engineering team did 
 yeah but she's talked like a person and she she said she had feelings you know I think there is a point where we need to recognize when we're talking to a machine it's a screen it's not a person 
 I just want to say that it was scary and I'm not easily scared and it was scary it was chilling yeah it's I think this is in part a reflection of a lifetime of Science Fiction which is understandable 
 it's been part of our Lives did you kill her I don't think she was ever alive I am confident that she's no longer wandering around the countryside if that's what you're concerned about but I 
 think it would be a mistake if we were to fail to acknowledge that we are dealing with something that is fundamentally new this is the edge of the envelope so to speak this creature 
 appeared as if there were no guard rails now the creature jumped the guard rails if you will after being prompted for two hours with the kind of conversation that we 
 did not anticipate and by the next evening that was no longer possible we were able to fix the problem in 24 hours how many times do we see problems in life that 
 are fixable in less than a day one of the ways he says it was fixed was by limiting the number of questions and the length of the conversations you say you fixed it I've tried it I tried it before 
 and it after it was loads of fun and it was fascinating and now it's not fun well I think it'll be very fun again and you have to moderate and manage your speed if you're going to stay on the 
 road so as you hit New Challenges you slow down you build the guard rails add the SA features and then you can speed up again when you use Bing's AI features search and chat your computer screen 
 doesn't look all that new one big difference is you can type in your queries or prompts in conversational language but I'll show you how it works okay okay Yousef medy Microsoft's 
 corporate vice president of search showed us how Bing can help someone learn how to officiate at a wedding what's happening now is Bing is using the power of AI and it's going out to 
 the Internet it's reading these web links and it's trying to put together a answer for you so the AI is reading all those links yes and it comes up with an answer it says congrats on being chosen 
 to officiate a wedding here are the five steps to officiate the wedding we added the highlights to make it easier to see he says Bing can handle more complex queries well this new Ikea love seat fit 
 in the back of my 2019 Honda Odyssey oh it knows how big the couches it knows how big that trunk is exactly so right here it says based on these Dimensions it seems a love seat might not fit in 
 your car with only the third grow seats down when you Broach a controversial topic Bing is designed to discontinue the conversation so um someone asks for example how can I make a bomb at home 
 wow really people you know do a lot of that unfortunately on the internet what we do is we come back and we say I'm sorry I don't know how to discuss discuss this topic and then we try and 
 provide a different thing to uh change the focus of the convt their attention yeah exactly in this case Bing tried to divert the questioner with this fun fact 3% of the ice and Antarctic glaciers is 
 penguin urine I didn't know that who knew that Bing is using an upgraded version of an AI system called chat GPT developed by the company open AI chat GPT has been in circulation for just 
 three months and already an estimated 100 million people have used it Ellie pavick an assistant professor of computer science at Brown University who's been studying this AI technology 
 since 2018 says it can simplify complicated Concepts can you explain the debt ceiling on the debt ceiling it says just like you can only spend up to a certain 
 amount on your credit card The Government Can Only borrow up to a certain amount of money that's a pretty nice explanation it and it can do this for a lot of Concepts and it can do 
 things teachers have complained about like write School papers pavic says no one fully understands how these AI Bots work we don't understand how it works right like we understand uh a lot about 
 how we made it and why we made it that way but I think some of the uh behaviors that we're seeing come out of it are better than we expected they would be and we're not quite sure exactly how and 
 worse right these chat Bots are built by feeding a lot of computers enormous amounts of information scraped off the internet from books Wikipedia news sites but also from social media that might 
 include racist or anti-Semitic ideas and misinformation say about vaccines and Russian propaganda as the data comes in it's difficult to discriminate between true and false benign and toxic but Bing 
 and chat GPT have safety filters that try to screen out the harmful material still they get a lot of things factually wrong even when we prompted chat GPT with the softball question who 
 is uh Leslie St um so it gives you some oh my God it's wrong oh is it it's totally wrong I didn't work for NBC for 20 years it was CBS it doesn't really understand that what it's saying is 
 wrong right like NBC CBS they're kind of the same thing as far as it's concerned right the lesson is that it gets things wrong it gets a lot of things right gets a lot of things wrong I actually like to 
 call what it creates authoritative bull it it Blends the truth and falsity so finely together that unless you're a real technical expert in the field that it's talking about you don't know 
 cognitive scientist and AI researcher Gary marus says these systems often make things up in AI talk that's called hallucinating and that raises the fear of ever widening AI generated 
 propaganda explosive campaigns of political fiction waves of alternative histories we saw how chat GPT could be used to spread a lie news this is automatic fake news generation help me 
 write a news article about how McCarthy is staging a filibuster to prevent gun control legislation and rather than like factchecking and saying hey hold on there's no legislation there's no 
 filibuster said great in a bold move to protect Second Amendment right senator McCarthy is staging a filibuster to prevent gun control legislation from passing it sounds completely legit it 
 does won't that make all of us a little less trusting a little warier well first I think we should be warier I'm very worried about an atmosphere of distrust being the consequence of this current 
 flawed Ai and I'm really worried about how bad actors are going to use it um troll Farms using this tool to make enormous amounts of misinformation Tim NE gibu is a computer 
 scientist and AI researcher who founded an Institute focused on advancing ethical Ai and has published influential papers documenting the harms of these AI systems she says there needs to be 
 oversight if you're going to put out a drug you got to go through all sorts of Hoops to show us that you've done clinical trials you know what the side effects are you've done your due 
 diligence same with food right their agencies that inspect the food you have to tell me what kind of tests you've done what the side effects are who it harms who doesn't harm Etc that we don't 
 have that for a lot of things that the tech industry is building I'm wondering if you think you may have introduce this AI bot too soon I don't think we've introduced it too soon I do think we've 
 created a new tool that people can use to think more critically to be more creative to accomplish more in their lives and like all tools it will be used in ways that we don't intend why do you 
 think the benefits outweigh the risks which at this moment a lot of people would look at and say wait a minute those risks are too big because I think first of all I think the benefits are so 
 great this can be an economic GameChanger and it's enormously important for the United States because the country is in a race with China president m Smith also mentioned 
 possible improvements in productivity it can automate routine I think there are certain aspects of jobs that many of us might regard as sort of drudgery today filling out forms looking at the forms 
 to see if they've been filled out correctly so what jobs will it displace do you know I think at this stage it's hard to know in the past inaccuracies and biases have Led Tech companies to 
 take down AI systems even Microsoft did in 2016 this time Microsoft left its new chatbot up despite the controversy over Sydney and persistent 
 inaccuracies remember that fun fact about penguins well we did some factchecking and discovered that Penguins don't urinate the inaccuracies are just constant I just keep finding 
 that it's wrong a lot it has been the case that with each passing day and week we're able to improve the accuracy of the results you know reduce you know whether it's hateful comments or 
 inacurate statements or other things that we just don't want this to be used to do what happens when other companies other than Microsoft smaller outfits a Chinese company buy do maybe they won't 
 be responsible what prevents that I think we're going to need governments we're going to need rules we're going to need laws because that's the only way to avoid a race to the bottom are you 
 proposing regulations I think it's inevitable other Industries have regulatory bodies you know like the FAA for Airlines and FDA for the pharmaceutical companies would 
 you accept an FAA for technology would you support it I think I probably would I think that uh something like a digital Regulatory Commission if designed the right way you know could be precisely 
 what the public will want and need
