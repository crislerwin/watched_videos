## SUMMARY

Amy Cuddy presents a TED Talk on the impact of body language on our feelings of power and confidence, suggesting that adopting "power poses" for two minutes can significantly alter our hormonal levels, making us feel more powerful and less stressed. She discusses the science behind body language, its effects on our self-perception and outcomes in life, such as job interviews, and encourages sharing this simple, no-tech life hack.

## IDEAS:

- Changing your posture for two minutes can significantly impact your life.
- Body language not only affects how others see us but also how we see ourselves.
- High-power poses can increase feelings of power and decrease stress.
- Nonverbal communication plays a crucial role in social judgments and outcomes.
- People's perceptions of physicians' niceness can predict lawsuit rates.
- Judgments based on politicians' faces can predict election outcomes.
- Using emoticons effectively in online negotiations can lead to better outcomes.
- Our nonverbals can influence our thoughts, feelings, and physiology.
- Nonverbal expressions of power and dominance are universal across the animal kingdom.
- Making yourself physically larger (expanding) is associated with power, while making yourself smaller (contracting) is associated with powerlessness.
- Gender differences exist in the use of power nonverbals, with women more likely to make themselves smaller.
- Participation in class and possibly other areas can be influenced by one's body language.
- "Fake it till you make it" can lead to real changes in behavior and self-perception.
- Power posing before a stressful event can change the outcome by altering our physiological state.
- High-power posers are more likely to be chosen for jobs based on their presence rather than the content of their speech.
- The concept of "faking it till you become it" as a way to internalize and become more powerful.
- Tiny tweaks in our body language can lead to significant changes in our lives.

- "Our bodies change our minds."
- "Don't fake it till you make it. Fake it till you become it."
- "Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes."
- "High-power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol."

## FACTS:

- Judgments of physicians' niceness based on silent video clips predict lawsuit rates.
- Judgments of political candidates' faces in just one second predict 70 percent of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes.
- High-power poses can lead to a 20-percent increase in testosterone levels and a 25-percent decrease in cortisol levels.
- Low-power poses can lead to a 10-percent decrease in testosterone levels and a 15-percent increase in cortisol levels.
- Participation counts for half the grade in MBA classrooms, highlighting the importance of nonverbal communication in academic settings.
- Gender differences in body language are linked to perceptions of power, with women more likely to make themselves smaller than men.
- High-power posers are more likely to be chosen for jobs based on their presence.
- People born with sight and those who are congenitally blind exhibit the same expressions of pride when winning at physical competitions.
- Nonverbal expressions of power and dominance are universal across the animal kingdom.
- The concept of "faking it till you become it" is supported by evidence that our bodies can change our minds.
