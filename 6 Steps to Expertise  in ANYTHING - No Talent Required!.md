# SUMMARY

The speaker is discussing Benjamin Bloom's method for becoming an expert, which involves six steps: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating. The speaker explains how this method can be applied to various domains, such as cooking and coding, to develop expertise.

# IDEAS:

- Bloom's method provides a clear roadmap to becoming an expert.
- Expertise does not require natural talent, just following the six steps.
- Memorization is the first step, but understanding and application are crucial.
- Critical thinking is essential for innovation and problem-solving.
- Evaluating one's own work and that of others is a key skill of experts.
- Creating something original is the ultimate goal of Bloom's taxonomy.
- Brilliant.org offers interactive lessons to help build expertise in STEM subjects.
- Hands-on learning and problem-solving are more effective than passive watching.
- Building a daily learning habit is key to unlocking one's full potential.
- Comparing models trained on different data sets can reveal the importance of training data.
- Becoming an expert requires dedication and following a structured approach.
- Experts understand the why behind their actions, not just the how.
- Explaining concepts to others is a powerful way to deepen one's own understanding.
- Practical application is essential for moving beyond just memorizing information.
- Critical thinking involves analyzing information from multiple sources to form one's own views.
- Evaluating one's own work and that of others is a hallmark of expertise.

# INSIGHTS:

- Expertise is not about natural talent, but a structured approach to learning.
- Mastering the fundamentals is the foundation for developing higher-order thinking skills.
- Critical thinking is essential for innovation, problem-solving, and making informed decisions.
- Evaluating one's own work and that of others is a key skill that distinguishes experts.
- Creating something original is the ultimate goal of developing expertise.
- Hands-on learning and building a daily habit are more effective than passive consumption.
- Understanding the why behind actions is more important than just memorizing the how.
- Explaining concepts to others is a powerful way to deepen one's own understanding.
- Practical application is essential for moving beyond just memorizing information.
- Analyzing information from multiple sources is crucial for forming one's own views.

# QUOTES:

- "Bloom's method gives you a map, tells you where you are, where you should be going, and how to get there."
- "Experts understand what each component does and why it's there."
- "Critical thinking is when you can read and analyze information from different sources and use it to form your own views, arguments, and decisions."
- "Without critical thinking, some of the greatest inventions in human history would not have been possible."
- "Experts can tell if what they do turns out as it should, and they can also critique the works of others."

# HABITS:

- Regularly using flashcards and self-testing to memorize key information.
- Explaining concepts to others as a way to deepen one's own understanding.
- Consistently practicing the skills and techniques of the domain of expertise.
- Critically analyzing information from multiple sources to form one's own views.
- Continuously evaluating one's own work and that of others to identify areas for improvement.

# FACTS:

- Bloom's taxonomy is a framework for categorizing thinking skills, not about stuffing dead animals.
- Brilliant.org is a learning platform created by experts from places like MIT, Caltech, and Microsoft.
- Brilliant's hands-on approach to learning is rooted in applying knowledge to unlock deeper comprehension.
- Brilliant's interactive lessons are designed to help build a daily learning habit.
- Comparing language models trained on different data sets can reveal the importance of training data.

# RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Develop a structured approach to learning, following Bloom's six-step method.
- Cultivate critical thinking skills by analyzing information from multiple sources.
- Regularly practice the skills and techniques of your domain of expertise.
- Explain concepts to others as a way to deepen your own understanding.
- Continuously evaluate your own work and that of others to identify areas for improvement.
