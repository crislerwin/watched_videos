# ‚úçÔ∏è The Video in 3 Sentences

# ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes

The 3 quotes in this video are:

2. You weren't born to work 40 hours a week doing something you hate numb your mind with endless scrolling and wake up one day wondering where the time went every day zoom out and think what would the highest version of myself do do that and ignore anyone that tries to convince you that something else is more important it's not.
4. Don't be afraid to fail. Build a product or service anyway so you can actually fail soon if you don't fail you don't have something to improve and if you just wait to put something off it's going to be a harder failure and you're going to get more discouraged and you need to pursue your goals and Achieve them so you actually have experience you can monetize sitting around and doing nothing keeps you trapped selling for someone else.
6. Your philosophy is your brand the way you live is your product. My Philosophy is that people should build their own thing become sovereign and do what they want my product is . is my writing system that allows people to do that the way I live is wake up write for 2 hours with breaks for creativity and handle other tasks in my business and that's pretty enticing I have results and a unique system that allowed me to do that.
