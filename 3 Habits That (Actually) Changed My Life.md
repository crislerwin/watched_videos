# 🌍 What It's About

"3 Habits That (Actually) Changed My Life" details the transformative journey of the author, who felt their efforts in life and work were not building towards anything substantial. To address this, they implemented three key habits that significantly altered their life for the better:

1. **Building Input-Output Loops**: The author shifted from being a passive participant in their career to actively seeking ways to link new inputs (information or experiences) to outputs (actions or creations), thereby creating a continuous cycle of learning and application. This approach led to unique insights and a reputation for having valuable, exclusive knowledge, especially highlighted through their work with YouTube algorithms and content creation.

2. **Improving Conversation Quality**: Realizing the importance of meaningful interactions, the author took steps to enhance the quality of their conversations. This involved finding like-minded individuals through writing courses and running their own courses, refining how they communicated ideas to make them more engaging, and having "selfish" conversations with smarter individuals through books and direct interactions. This not only enriched their social interactions but also their personal growth and satisfaction.

3. **Avoiding Caffeine for the First Hour After Waking**: Based on a recommendation by Andrew Huberman, the author adopted the habit of delaying caffeine consumption for the first hour after waking up, combined with exposure to sunlight and morning yoga. This change led to clearer thinking and a more productive and energized start to the day.

These habits, according to the author, were easy to implement and have had a profound impact on their life, addressing issues of feeling unproductive, disconnected, and unfulfilled. The note concludes with an invitation for readers to subscribe to their content for more insights.
