 hi everyone while Nvidia has long provided the gpus that AI training relies on discontent is brewing Sam Altman is Seeking a staggering $7 trillion to address current scalability 
 limitations which would reinvent AI chip development and the semiconductor industry as a whole how exactly does nvidia's approach fall short what technology or infrastructure could 
 possibly demand such an enormous sum keep watching to learn more this video has three parts y $7 trillion geopolitical concerns and AI Hardware Renaissance part one why $7 trillion 
 it's been all over the news the past week or two Sam Altman the CEO of open aai has been seeking lots of money to build an AI chip Venture where lots of money is between 5 and7 trillion let's 
 put that into perspective for a moment in 2022 the US federal budget was 6. 3 trillion so this amount of funding could exceed the entire US federal budget and also incidentally the GDP of Japan which 
 is about $4 4.23 trillion in fact even putting specific countries aside that's about 7% of the global GDP that's simply an enormous sum of money it's also primarily a dig against Nvidia because 
 Nvidia is the primary supplier of AI chips right now so predictably the Nvidia CEO downplay this he spoke to a middle eastern audience the same people that Sam Alpin was seeking the funding 
 from and the Nvidia CEO said the current data center infrastructure across the whole world the installed base is about $1 trillion worth and he predicted that the world would need to build another $1 
 trillion worth of similar infrastructure over the next 5 years so first of all a doubling period of 5 years might seem a little slow because of the pace that AI is currently developing at but of course 
 building and deploying Hardware infrastructure does take a long time keep in mind as well that Nvidia is the incumbent here they want to uphold the status quo because the status quo is 
 everybody paying absurd sums of money for NVIDIA gpus in fact purely as a result of the AI boom and subsequent demand for Nvidia gpus nvidia's stock price tripled last year and Nvidia is 
 now more valuable than Amazon I actually don't know if that will be true by the time you watch this video because the valuations are constantly moving around a little bit but yeah Nvidia is now 
 valued at about $1.8 trillion so hearing some of these numbers like $1 trillion of infrastructure or Nvidia worth $1.8 trillion means that 5 to 7 trillion doesn't sound quite so outlandish but 
 we'll go into that in more detail it's worth noting that this is not the first time that Sam Alman has sought funding to create a chip Venture in fact right around the time that he was being ousted 
 as the CEO of open aai temporarily as it turns out he was actually seeking bu billions of dollars in funding for a chip called Tigris which didn't exist yet but which was supposed to eventually 
 compete with Nvidia and he was seeking that funding from the exact same people that he is now asking for trillions from investors in the Middle East so why did he raise the amount so much from 
 billions to trillions well he's in a stronger position now because he's really Consolidated his power over open AI which is no longer this sort of hybrid between a nonprofit and a 
 for-profit company but rather is basically just an ordinary Tech startup at this point but I do think that it's a fully honest pitch Sam believes in the power of trillions of dollars to reshape 
 the semiconductor industry and for some reason he thinks that's necessary which again we'll go into more as this video progresses apparently Sam Altman has been taking a bit of a beating over this 
 news because the figure of trillions sounds too outlandish to everybody and after a week he quietly pulled back a little bit and news sites are reporting that he privately told people that the 
 figure represents the sum total of all the Investments That would be needed in everything from Real Estate to power to designing chips and building Fabs over a period of years which only makes sense 
 you couldn't burn through trillions of dollars that quickly the mythical man trillion wouldn't let you my analysis is that it's a bet on long-term transformation and a bet on exponential 
 growth if Nvidia thinks that data centers will grow relatively slowly doubling over 5 years Sam Altman's bet is that we're at the early stages of an exponential and that we will need to 
 grow much more rapidly than that and I think that even if AGI arises in the interim it's a project that would continue because AGI and more sophisticated AI would also like a 
 massive Venture into producing technology that's useful for AI as for why Sam might be looking for this money from the Middle East which doesn't really have any semiconductor 
 manufacturing capability right now it's because the Middle East is one of the few places in the world that could write such a check in fact putting aside private Venture even a lot of 
 governments couldn't afford to write such a check again for comparison the Apollo space program cost the US about $300 billion in today's currency while Biden's clean energy plan is going to 
 cost more than originally anticipated about $1 trillion over a 10-year period so basically Sam Altman is trying to get private Equity to play at government policy and the Middle East because of 
 all the oil that they've dug up over the years has a massive concentration of funds in Sovereign wealth funds it's a very secure source of financing which would be necessary to make such a 
 massive project succeed and from the perspective of the governments in the Middle East I'm sure they would like to diversify their economy Beyond Reliance on oil and gas and bringing the most 
 Hightech of manufacturing right to your doorstep is a great way to do that this is a project that could only work in the Middle East or potentially somewhere with a lot more government assistance 
 instead of just private funding and even then only from a few of the wealthiest countries in the world part two geopolitical concerns what's wrong with the status quo why might Sam Altman be 
 trying to disrupt that as you might have guessed because there's so much money and power involved in being able to produce Advanced microchips chip production is an intensely geopolitical 
 Adventure let's talk about the present right now Advanced chip manufacturing happens in exactly one place in the whole world in Taiwan there's one company there that has a virtual 
 monopoly tsmc or the Taiwan semiconductor Manufacturing Company the history of tsmc is fascinating and I'll include a link in the description if you'd like to read more probably I'll 
 talk about it more in another video but just for quick numbers they have about 59% of the total market share of Chip Manufacturing in the world but probably capture about 80% of the total revenue 
 because they produce the most advanced chips and to make this production work there's a global supply chain that includes IP from the US equipment from the Netherlands assembly in China other 
 parts produced in Vietnam Etc This Global Supply Chain is very brittle which has led to supply chain shortages due to pandemic shocks and other reasons as tensions are increasing between 
 nations especially the US and China a lot of countries are trying to create their own chip manufacturing capabilities in the US for example there's the chips act which is trying to 
 reshore chip manufacturing but let's pause for a moment and ask how did this situation even arise after all globalization was an American idea from a world where the US dominated all 
 military and economic matters and could shape relations between all the countries in the world right now the US doesn't like that it's so dependent on Taiwan for advanced chips because Taiwan 
 is so close to China and at potential risk of being invaded But this is an artifact of a system that the US itself created let's break it down one of the fundamental building blocks of economic 
 foreign policy is tariffs on trade which basically means means when you try to import something from another country then the Tariff will apply and they'll charge like 20% tax on it or whatever 
 the number is tariffs were much more common historically as a way for a country to protect its own domestic Industries they were also an excellent way for wealthier countries to block 
 imports from less advanced economies thereby making sure that those poorer countries didn't evolve those advanced economies in the first place until these wealthy countries had a great idea and 
 realized they could EXP support their IP laws their intellectual property laws what does that mean well intellectual property laws are basically copyright laws trade secret laws patent laws that 
 kind of thing and they prevent one person from illegally copying or profiting off of someone else's work within a country's economy but until recently most countries had their own IP 
 laws which is why for example multinational corporations would always have to file for a patent in tons of countries around the world because just because you have a US patent doesn't 
 necessarily mean that in Europe you're going to have protection from competitors copying that product so you kind of deal with it by putting tariffs in place and focusing more on a domestic 
 Market but the US decided to introduce this concept called free trade which sounds great it has the word free in it and it means no tariffs essentially free flow of goods across National borders 
 which sounds great except that if intellectual property rights are not carried across National borders as well then as soon as someone files a patent in the US and starts creating a cool new 
 WI there's nothing stopping someone in a different country from just copying that blatantly copying it and then selling it back into the US market or even if the US blocked that selling it to a third 
 country the UK loves buying cheap widgets for example so the US spearheaded a series of free trade agreements starting with NAFTA which included all of North America so Canada 
 and Mexico and then a World Trade Organization agreement in 1999 this agreement took down all the tariffs and said you have to respect in ual property law specifically us intellectual 
 property law which meant that companies for example American companies were free to take their intellectual property export it to a much cheaper third world country and build factories there and so 
 on which had the added benefit from the perspective of the advanced economies in the world that the majority of the profits would still stay within the advanced economies the people that were 
 creating the intellectual property were the ones reaping the vast majority of the benefits while everyone else just got really terrible factory jobs this was the root cause that led to a lot of 
 really brittle Supply chains such as the ones in the semiconductor industry including nvidia's own Supply chains I want to pause and offer a book recommendation now and the book series 
 is called the interdependency it's science fiction where a bunch of different systems have specialized in producing very particular types of goods in fact they have an Empire granted 
 Monopoly over the production of certain goods and yes all these star systems enforce each other's intellectual property anyway anyway in that series of three books a massive catastrophe starts 
 to befall all the star systems and they start getting cut off from each other in terms of communication and in terms of shipping yes it's an analogy for a highly globalized world one that is very 
 prone to shocks to the system John scaly the author actually said so anyway check it out if you're interested the first book in the interdependency is called the collapsing Empire in addition to 
 these issues with globalization and brittle Supply chains semiconductor manufacturing actually has an additional problem and that problem is monopolies for example Apple can block all other 
 companies from accessing the most advanced microprocessors by simply pre- purchasing the entire production supply of tsmc and they do in fact do this the thing is the monopolies don't want any 
 of this to change tsmc loves being the only producer because they can set prices AMD Nvidia Apple they all love being such heavy weights in their industry that they too can set their own 
 production goals set their own prices and not really worry about upstarts coming in because the upstarts can't access an alternative to tsmc the problem here is the Company's trying to 
 extract maximum possible profits without much regulation and like most monopolies a lot of these companies are not really spending their money on Innovation they're spending it on stock BuyBacks 
 and dividends so that the shareholders feel really great about the company because that's the logical thing to do if you're a monopoly make sure your shareholders and the legislation that 
 affects you are all in your favor in the words of Corey doow the chips act treats the symptoms but not the causes because globalization itself doesn't cause all these problems it's globalization 
 combined with monopolies combined with shocks to the system and until now we haven't had shocks to the system so it didn't matter but we're going to keep having more and more of those as the 
 climate crisis evolves and so on the chips act and most of the public are thinking about going after globalization which also makes sense if there's going to be Wars or other unrest but they're 
 ignoring the Monopoly part which is actually the easiest part to deal with well not easy because the monopolistic companies are going to fight you every step of the way but all it takes is 
 legislation breaking up the companies or putting in place rules about how they act and how they use their money for example the production of dram or the memory that goes into computers and 
 phones is also extremely complicated not quite as complicated as producing really Advanced CPUs and gpus but very intense nevertheless and Dam manufacturing is a highly competitive space if you buy a 
 new device it might have memory produced by one of half a dozen or more different companies which are located in different Geographic jurisdictions and when incentives come their way from the chips 
 act those companies are actually doing research and building Fabs and so on because if they don't they'll lose the Competitive Edge to other companies that are in the same space but in 
 semiconductor manufacturing Apple who's one of the worst offenders in this regard has literally no reason to take any chip money at all and do anything they'll just keep paying tsmc the more 
 things change the more they remain the same a lot of this section by the way was based on Research done by Corey doow so I'll link his article in the description below if you'd like to read 
 more about it so as you can see there are a lot of issues right now with the semiconductor industry from globalization to monopolistic Behavior to companies that are probably thinking 
 about doing just what they've always been doing grow slowly keep making gpus that's what Nvidia is thinking right now but if we're truly on an exponential growth curve as Sam Alman must think we 
 are then another approach might be required an approach that costs trillions part three AI Hardware Renaissance a multi- trillion dollar investment into AI Hardware would 
 certainly create a lot of new ideas and a lot of new capabilities it would allow an almost complete redesign and a rearching of a lot of the assumptions that underly current hard Ware for 
 example current AI accelerators try their best to fit into existing standards for example gpus slot into the pcie interface inside standard motherboards this restricts them to 
 certain power consumption to certain memory bandwidth which is important because those things have to be co-designed with motherboard manufacturers and CPU manufacturers but 
 that's because we're just thinking about a computer as having a CPU having a motherboard and having gpus as we think about investing more and more into this Hardware it can become more and more 
 specialized and dedicated I dug up a few interesting examples there's a company called cerebras which has produced two systems cs1 in about 2019 and CS2 in 2021 CS2 uses what they call W2 or the 
 wafer scale engine Wafers are those really big circular discs that they produce microchips on and typically a wafer contains tons and tons of instances of the same CPU or micro chip 
 architecture this is partially because it costs many many thousands of dollars to produce one silicon wafer and partially also because every wafer has a certain number of defects in it so if 
 you produce a fairly small chip then the chance of having defects is low but what cerebrus did is they made the chip the entire size of the wafer which is pretty insane a small number of defects and you 
 probably have to throw away the entire wafer most likely they designed a certain amount of redundancy into the chip so that if there's defects in certain areas you can just disable 
 certain regions and get slightly fewer cores that's a fairly standard precaution for CPU design these days anyway these wafer scale processors are specifically designed for AI and because 
 they're so huge they have 850,000 cores that's right it's not like a four core computer it's like an 850,000 core computer for comparison an Nvidia a100 has about 7,000 cores in it and an h100 
 has about 15,000 cores these are special ized cores like GPU cores or AI cores they need far less silicon than CPU cores do so you can get to much higher numbers but still 850,000 that's insane 
 as one commentator said it's one of those products that if you have to ask you can't afford it it's the largest chip ever built 2.6 trillion transistors and a surface area of 462 CM assuming 
 it's square that means it's 21.5 CM on each Axis or 8 1/2 in if you live in the US let's see wait a minute here there you go 8 and 1/2 in by 8 1/2 in pretty big for a CPU core it seems the company 
 cerebrus plans to rent computers containing these CPUs for about $1.6 million per year and they certainly cost millions of dollars to buy outright I don't know the exact cost just to 
 mention as well this company produced these insane chips in 2021 so if you have a few million dollars burning a hole in your pocket you can probably get them today and the company is thinking 
 of going public in 2024 so these cerebrus chips would almost certainly be used for model training not for inference which I think is Sam Altman's primary consideration as well so you 
 could imagine a world where Sam Alman would invest a lot in this company or license their technology or something like that I found another company that is focused on model inference and it's 
 called tum tum was trying to produce a 96 core processor this processor called The Prodigy processor seems a lot more like a CPU to me which is why it has a lower core count and that CPU would be 
 paired with 1 tbte of RAM and put into a standard ATX motherboard it would probably only cost like $10,000 that's my guess the company says $5,000 right now but that doesn't really add up tum 
 designed this system specifically so that it could actually take a trillion parameter model and run inference on it remember we think that gp4 has about a trillion parameters it has some special 
 4bit floating Point data type I don't know the details but that lets them cut the memory use in half from floating Point numbers that are 8 Bits and that's how they think they can fit a trillion 
 parameters into one terabyte of memory however tm's ability to deliver on This Promise is in serious doubt because they were originally going to release their processor like 3 years ago or four years 
 ago and it keeps getting pushed probably keeps getting changed as well because they want to be able to do inference at least theoretically do inference on the largest models on the market not to be 
 outdone the big tech companies are also get getting involved in all this AI chip production Google was actually the first company as far as I know to make special purpose AI chips they created tensor 
 processing units or tpus for their Cloud systems in 2018 I remember that announcement when it happened and now my pixel phone has a processor inside it that has some special tensor cores 
 Microsoft is producing two new Chips specifically for AI training for its Cloud for Azure Nvidia is going to just keep doing what they're doing and like I said they're about as valuable as Amazon 
 now so it's working for them and AMD is the closest thing Nvidia has to competition but the biggest problem with AMD gpus is not the actual Hardware in fact they're often more power efficient 
 and arguably better designed than the Nvidia ones the real problem is that AMD doesn't control the entire stack all the software is built on Nvidia specific things like Cuda so unless AMD makes 
 Hardware that's much much better than Nvidia is no one's going to take the time to change that software stack so they're playing from behind basically and I think that's also part of the 
 reason that Sam ultiman is thinking this has to be a really big investment because you have to design the chips you have to build the Fabs outside of Taiwan you have to maybe replace the 
 motherboard or the CPU with equivalents you have to build data centers get electricity for those data centers you have to rebuild the software stack that actually runs in those data centers 
 there are so many moving pieces that have to be addressed or I guess you could force Nvidia to standardize a lot of its stuff if AMD and open AI could all produce Nvidia compatible gpus then 
 that would solve a lot of problems but good luck getting Nvidia to agree to that actually it's not just AI chips that are experiencing a bit of a Renaissance in addition to Intel and AMD 
 which have produced CPUs for a long time Qualcomm and Nvidia are both producing desktop CPUs they're based on arm not x86 but they're going to be legitimate competitors to Intel and AMD the days of 
 going to a Best Buy and seeing every laptop with an Intel chip in it might be over but like I said that's a really good thing there's too much consolidation in the microprocessor 
 Market competition will force those firms to spend their money wisely at least in theory and if not well all it will take is $7 trillion of investment to get a viable alternative finally I 
 want to note that if if Sam ultimate is seeking $77 trillion of investment money that means that those investors would expect to get a return on their investment which means that he would 
 expect that venture to be worth many times 7 trillion which is insane if it grew to 10x its current value to 70 trillion that would be about the size of the entire GDP of the world today which 
 means that if there's any Financial sense in that type of plan whatsoever that AI is about to truly transform everybody's life lives imagine spending 50% of your salary on AI focused stuff 
 that might be the world we're about to live in finally in conclusion we talked about some of the implications of Sam Altman seeking $7 trillion in investment to build out semiconductor manufacturing 
 specifically trying to create AI chips that don't suffer from production bottlenecks and the Monopoly behavior of Nvidia we also talked a lot about the geopolitical reasons that globalization 
 and monopolies like Nvidia or tsmc have Arisen in the first place to be clear monopolies are a natural result of a capitalist Market but the government is supposed to initiate Anti-Trust lawsuits 
 against companies that actually become monopolies that's what ensures that competition arises and keeps everybody operating efficiently but antitrust becomes a little more difficult when 
 your government is strongly deregulated and when your company's activities are spread all across the world because of globalization finally we talked about the AI Hardware Renaissance that seems 
 to be unfolding there are tons of startups out there that are trying to create different AI chips or AI Hardware of one form or another because everybody knows it's such a huge Market but nobody 
 really thought that it was as big as Sam Altman I think before he started making these pitches it will be interesting to say the least what happens I think it probably depends a lot on how much of 
 the exponential growth curve that we'll be experiencing on data and models will translate into exponential requirements on Hardware maybe we'll just double the number of data centers over 5 years or 
 maybe our economy will become half AI focused one out of every $2 spent on AI models and AI infrastructure if you liked this video check out this previous one I made where I did a much deeper 
 dive into how gpus work and why they are the way they are it's a bit technical but it has some fun anecdotes as well all right that's all I have for today thank you very much for watching
