SUMMARY:
In this video, Derek from Veritasium discusses how Euclid's fifth postulate in his book "Elements" led to the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries and ultimately to Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the shape of our universe.

IDEAS:
- Euclid's "Elements" summarized all known mathematics at the time using definitions, common notions, and five postulates to prove 465 theorems.
- The fifth postulate, also known as the parallel postulate, seemed suspicious to many mathematicians who tried to prove it from the other four postulates for over 2,000 years.
- János Bolyai and Carl Friedrich Gauss independently discovered that the fifth postulate could be changed, leading to new consistent non-Euclidean geometries like hyperbolic geometry.
- Spherical geometry, where there are no parallel lines, was later recognized as another non-Euclidean geometry.
- Bernhard Riemann generalized the concept of geometry to allow curvature to differ from place to place and extend to higher dimensions.
- Einstein's theory of general relativity, based on the idea that massive objects curve spacetime, relies on the behavior of straight lines in curved geometries.
- Gravitational lensing, where massive objects bend light from distant sources, provides observational evidence for general relativity.
- The shape of the entire universe can be determined by measuring the angles of very large triangles using the cosmic microwave background radiation.
- Current measurements suggest that the universe is flat within a very small margin of error.
- The fact that the universe has the right mass-energy density to be flat seems remarkably serendipitous.

QUOTES:
- "A single sentence in one of the oldest math books held the key to understanding our universe."
- "Out of nothing, I have created a strange new universe." - János Bolyai
- "To praise it would amount to praising myself for the entire content of the work coincides almost exactly with my own meditations, which have occupied my mind for the past 30 or 35 years." - Carl Friedrich Gauss
- "It's beautiful that he wrote this. It's beautiful that people spent 2,000 years trying to refute him, only to discover that, in fact, he was right in writing this in the first place."
- "If you give me a definition in terms of other things, then you have to tell me what those things are. If you tell me what that is, you have to tell me what the thing before it is."

HABITS:
- Spending days and nights working on challenging mathematical problems, like János Bolyai did with the parallel postulate.
- Carefully examining the work of others and providing constructive feedback, as Carl Friedrich Gauss did with Bolyai's work.
- Thinking deeply about the fundamental principles and assumptions underlying a field of study, as mathematicians did with Euclid's postulates.
- Seeking to reconcile seemingly contradictory ideas, as Einstein did with relativity and gravity.
- Using thought experiments to gain new insights, like Einstein's happiest thought of a man falling off a roof.

FACTS:
- Euclid's "Elements" has been published in more editions than any other book except the Bible.
- János Bolyai was not only a brilliant mathematician but also a skilled violinist and an undefeated duelist.
- Carl Friedrich Gauss was a geodesist and took measurements of the Earth, which led some to speculate that he was trying to measure the curvature of space itself.
- In 1854, Bernhard Riemann changed Euclid's second postulate to allow for "unbounded" lines, making spherical geometry a valid non-Euclidean geometry.
- In 2014, astronomers observed the same supernova in four different places due to gravitational lensing caused by a massive galaxy between the supernova and Earth.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Study Euclid's "Elements" to understand the foundations of geometry and the importance of rigorous mathematical proofs.
- Learn about the lives and works of János Bolyai, Carl Friedrich Gauss, and Bernhard Riemann to appreciate their contributions to non-Euclidean geometry.
- Explore the concepts of special and general relativity to grasp how our understanding of space, time, and gravity has evolved.
- Keep an open mind when faced with ideas that seem counterintuitive or contradictory, as they may lead to groundbreaking discoveries.
- Engage in thought experiments and seek to find connections between seemingly disparate fields, as this can lead to new insights and understanding.
- Stay curious about the fundamental principles and assumptions underlying various fields of study, and be willing to question them when necessary.
- Pursue your passions with dedication and perseverance, even in the face of challenges or setbacks, as exemplified by the mathematicians who spent centuries trying to prove or refute Euclid's fifth postulate.
