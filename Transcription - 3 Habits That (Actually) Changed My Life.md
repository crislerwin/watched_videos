 I wasn't building any specific skills I was just kind of building little sand castles everywhere that crumbled after the project ended.
So I decided I need to change this 3 years ago I felt drained I felt like I was wasting time doing all of this work but it wasn't building up to anything and the closest people were drifting from me because we weren't really interested in the same things anymore and it was hard to be who I am around them so entered Co where everything was put to a pause and I tried a bunch of habits and three of them changed all three of the problems 
 they were really easy to implement and effortless to apply now that I've been doing for three plus years so I wanted to share with you the three habits that really changed my life the first one is 
 build input output Loops what I realized early on in my career was I was a good employee people would give me things to do and I did as I was told I think I did them pretty well but you know at the end 
 of the year I don't have any groundbreaking Insight I didn't have any unique contributions that other people couldn't do I wasn't building any specific skills I was just kind of 
 building little sand castles everywhere that crumbled after the project ended so I decided I need to change this I'm going to build a loop an input output Loop so what that means is I have my 
 inputs and that feeds directly into an output that I do but with the output I am going to seek more input and that's going to the next output so everything links together and I'm spiraling up and 
 learning and building up on something for example when I was working at YouTube part of the job was to learn the latest YouTube algorithm changes and then you run workshops or meetings with 
 big YouTube channels so you know you can help them grow and most people stop there right input is the training and the output is the workshop that you run so you know easy you finish and you do 
 something else but of course I was building my Loop so I'm not going to end there what I would do is okay I learned the material I run the workshop and at the workshop I want to gain more input 
 so I talk to the big YouTubers find out how they hack the algorithm they think about this 24/7 so a lot of them had really unique insights that were not covered on the YouTube training material 
 so for example one of the YouTubers said oh since YouTube introduced chapters what I would do is make my chapter titles SEO optimized so actually I get more traffic from Google search so 
 whenever you know you search on Google for a question they will give you YouTube video suggestion so her videos started to show up there and I thought fascinating not at all covered by the 
 YouTube training material and so I would take that and I reach out to the Google search team you ask them oh you know when how do you think about surfacing YouTube channels and they would tell me 
 even a bit more based and I could reply and I could discuss because I had some information from the YouTubers based on what I've learned there then I could do more outputs when I'm talking to other 
 YouTubers now I can say you know there's an interesting hack that you can do or I can whenever I'm doing cross functional meetings there's unique insights that I can provide and no one else knows about 
 and of course as an output I run my own YouTube channel so I experiment with my own Channel all of this is building on top of each other over time you build reputation for yourself that you have 
 information asymmetry this is a huge competitive advantage in our information World they know that when I come to Vicki she has some unique insights that somehow other people don't have and that 
 is building the input output Loop and even if you say okay I work I can't really do that you know it sounds too complicated you can do that with the content that you consume we all consume 
 a lot of content so I decided Well if I'm I have this much input I need some sort of Outlet I need some sort of output to actually cement in what I'm learning so I'm writing creating YouTube 
 videos and just that process itself is you're doing more than 99% of the people and once you do that right you leave comments I talk to my writer friends you know they talk about this I get random 
 inbound emails saying oh I saw this article you did is exactly what I'm doing with my business can we discuss this so I get so much more input just by putting something out and based on those 
 discussions then I can improve my videos I think of new ways to do my videos new topics so it really is a virtuous cycle and this virtu cycle gets me ahead of most of my peers who are still building 
 sand castles this came about when I realized one of my closest childhood friends kept on cutting me off in our conversation I remember this one instance which made me 
 realize I need to change I was telling her about my favorite book how PR can change your life it's so witty the author Alan debaton he had such clear observations and he put into words what 
 I was feeling but never had the words for it's a weird mix of self-help and literary review of this French author which I studied when I was in Paris it was just mind-blowing and I was gushing 
 about the book and my friend said oh yeah um so I'm actually thinking of going to Paris this summer where should I stay and she completely cut me off she wasn't listening you know clearly my TED 
 Talk was of zero interest to her and that's when I realized even if someone is a close friend one they won't be interested in everything that I'm interested in and two even if they were 
 they shouldn't be there listening to me ramble about something so instead of calling her hey you know she's just a friend who never listens to me I decided I needed to change and have better 
 conversations and there were three things I did to change the quality of my life and the quality of my conversations the first thing was finding a group of people who cared about the same things 
 as I do you know I want to talk about philosophy I want to talk about how the world works I want to talk about Frameworks I want to talk about ideas from books and you know have a 
 discussion about them and people in real life a lot of them were interested in this so I thought okay let me 8020 this and find the right people so writing is a proxy for curiosity for me so I joined 
 a writing course and lo and behold I met some of my favorite people on the internet who cared about the same things as I did and yes it's possible to make friends as adult when you share similar 
 interests second you know I started running my own courses about things I cared about and you know we gather as a group who cared about framework thinking we cared about ideas and three it's so 
 important to me to have these conversations I started my own Cafe Da Vinci Cafe with my friend Fay all about think at the intersection doing associative thinking so yeah if you feel 
 the same you can find our Link in the description and join one of the cafes the second thing to do is refine your idea and realize that just like a comedian when they tell a joke they tell 
 it once and they tweak how they tell the joke based on how people react it and you tweak it over time even on stage you tweak it over time so that you find the best way to tell the joke in a way that 
 people get it they're laughing they're having a good time and you are evoking that emotion that you want in them so same with us if I say something it doesn't land the first time well I have 
 more opportunities to talk about it and tweak it I use Da Vinci cafes to do that I use my writing to do that just to how can I best describe this idea when I was telling my friend who cut me off I was 
 telling her there's this idea in there about cliches the problem with cliches is not that they are bad ideas but is they are superficial articulations of really good ideas and when I said it 
 like that she was like oh yeah okay like and then what you know so it didn't land and I realized I tried different versions I tried you know maybe telling my own story when I'm writing blah blah 
 blah not interesting but when I said hey you know what can we do a test of whether you see the world in 2D or 3D immediately hooked right and I say okay if you see a sunset how would you 
 describe it and she was like uh it's um on fire or yeah I guess you know it looks like it's on fire ah it's a cliche right and then I go into the details of you know what it's good that it's a 
 cliche but you are borrowing how other people are seeing the world but when you actually notice the sunset and really look at it you'll see that it's not just on fire there's so much more going on 
 and so we had this huge discussion about sunsets we actually went to see one and then she was like oh holy crap like this is deep can I borrow that book you know so this is really what I'm talking about 
 refining those ideas giving yourself that permission to talk about ideas in different ways and don't get discouraged really improve the quality of the conversations I was having the third 
 thing I do to improve the quality of my conversations is to have more selfish conversations with people who are way smarter than me and I start with books right I don't have philosophers deep 
 thinkers you know business people all around me but no problem they've all written books so I start with the books and you know engage in a conversation with them through the book I ask them 
 questions in the margins right I think about oh yeah this this is a really good point I realized that this happened in my life and I start to have a deep rich reading experience and sometimes the 
 questions you ask will be answered by the book sometimes the questions won't be answered in which case then you are able to know okay based on this question I have which books should I read next 
 this way you're curating your content diet right not just okay here's social media let me flip through whatever's there but you have a direction towards what you want to read what you want to 
 find out what you care about some people feel like you know I don't even know what I I'm interested in I have no purpose in life start having conversations with books and you'll 
 start to see your interests and you'll naturally curate your information diet once you do that you really go to the shoari process I talked about it in video in this video here in detail but 
 basically you know first you learn from the master and then you start to break the mold of the master and then you start to create your own thing it really is a powerful method to have 
 conversations with those who are really smart and then you can bring it into your real life once you feel more comfortable you know that you ask good questions you're building up this base 
 of knowledge based on what you're reading sometimes like cold email and I go on LinkedIn and try to connect with people who I don't even know sometimes I just talk to people around me right lots 
 of people are ahead in their careers lots of people are in different fields right I asked them you know what are the Frameworks that you have distilled what are the interesting learnings and I'm 
 trying to connect the dots right do that associative thinking okay let's say in physics this happens in philosophy something else happens I see a connection and I share with them so I 
 can also give back to the discussion this is definitely something I will continue to do more of in 2024 for sure because you know sometimes I am shy and I get scared like oh what if I can't 
 even say anything intelligent but you know the point is not to prove that I am intelligent the point is to learn from them so that's something I'm going to continue practicing the power of having 
 better conversations it doesn't just enrich social interactions but it really enriches your personal satisfaction and learning as well two birds with one stone I love stuff like that the third 
 habit I'm definitely keeping is not having caffeine the first hour from when you wake wake up apparently Andrew huberman also recommended this as well is for the first hour you know start 
 your morning with sunlight and don't drink caffeine until an hour later it will give you a clearer head and I can a th% vouch for that I did this by accident because we moved and I didn't 
 have this beautiful espresso machine with my ritual of spending 10 minutes to get the coffee ready and then you having two sips and it's gone and combine it with yoga that I do every morning so I 
 guess that's a bonus habit that I also picked up and will continue to do I felt so on on top of things I felt so productive in my morning so healthy in my morning I was energized to get my Tod 
 list started and of course if you want to see how I tackle my to-do list here's a video on that and if you watched all the way till here thank you if you enjoyed it please consider entering into
